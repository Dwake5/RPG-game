## Battle Simulation

This is a game I made in Python. It was created as an exercise to reinforce what I have learnt during tutorials, reading and lectures.

In the game, you are pitted against 3 enemies. One having much higher health and stats, this is the boss and when defeated your party wins.

There are 4 stats each character has:
Health - When this gets to zero, the character dies and can not be resurrected
MP - Magic points are used to cast spells, this can be restored
Attack - When you use a basic attack you hit for this amount +- 20%
Def - Basic attacks are reduced by an amount between 1 and this amount.

Each character also has spells they can use. Your party has access to damage and healing, the enemies have a lower array of damage ones, with the boss having stronger. Spells hit for 0.8 - 1.4x of their base damage

Your team also starts with a variety of items, shared among members. There are a few different healing potions, elixers which restore hp and mp, and a high damage dealing grenade.

You have three members in your party. If they are die, you lose. They each have differing stats, allowing for different gameplay options and allowing them to specialize and the player create strategies.

Features include:

- An array of party members facing,
- An array of enemies
- Basic attacks
- Magic abilities, damage and healing
- Items, which heal and attack
- AI on enemies, who use magic or attack
- Lots of models and functions
- Health and MP bars

Q. What more could be added to this?
A. An absolute ton, an endless amount.
It could have a story, equipment (swords, shield etc), upgrades and a skill tree, it could be left in its current form, but all enemy stats go up 5 or 10% each time you win allowing for a high score system. You could face random enemies each time from a long list increasing variety.
